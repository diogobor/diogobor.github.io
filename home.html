	<h1>Resume</h1>
<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://ufrj.br/en/" target="_blank">Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)</a>, in Brazil, as well as an M.Sc. in Computer Science specialising in Artificial Intelligence from the UFRJ's <a href="https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/en/" target="_blank">Systems Engineering and Computer Science Program</a>. I also have a Ph.D. in Biosciences and Biotechnology from the <a href="http://www.icc.fiocruz.br" target="_blank">Carlos Chagas Institute / Fiocruz</a>, where I developed a search tool called <a href="http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl" target="_blank">SIM-XL</a> for complex scenarios involving cross-linked peptides, aiding structural proteomics and protein-protein interaction studies.
During my first post-doc in computational proteomics at <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/mass-spectrometry-for-biology/" target="_blank">Institut Pasteur</a> in Paris, I have developed new bioinformatics solutions for analyzing top-down proteomics data. In my second post-doc at the <a href="https://leibniz-fmp.de/research/research-section/structural-biology/fan-liu-structural-interactomics" target="_blank">Leibniz-FMP</a> in Berlin, I focused on not only cross-linking mass spectrometry data analysis using cleavable reagents but also the developments of tools to turn the peptides identification faster.
Currently, I'm Research Scientist in computational proteomics at <a href="https://www.exactsciences.com/" target="_blank">Exact Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>I have experience in Proteomics Data Analysis (Bottom-up &amp; Top-down) and Quantitative Mass Spectrometry, Structural Mass Spectrometry, Natural Optimization (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Simulated Annealing), Statistical Classifiers (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Classifiers etc.), Artificial Neural Networks (e.g., Feed Forward with back propagation), Statistical Inference and advanced experience in Python, Java, C# and C++.</p>
